# SECURE BACKEND API #

For this project I've built only the backend to serve APIs for the frontend. I've used Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
<br/>
Deployed both frontend and backend on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, S3, CloudFront, Route53, IAM.

## Usage ##

The user can:

- Register and login;
- Share a post (image) and edit or delete it if the owner;
- Like or dislike a post;
